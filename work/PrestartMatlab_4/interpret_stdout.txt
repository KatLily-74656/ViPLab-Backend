>>  LS List directory.
    LS displays the results of the 'ls' command on UNIX. On UNIX, 
    LS returns a character row vector of filenames separated 
    by tab and space characters. On Windows, LS returns an m-by-n 
    character array of filenames, where m is the number of filenames 
    and n is the number of characters in the longest filename found. 
    Filenames shorter than n characters are padded with space characters.
 
    You can pass any flags to LS as well that your operating system supports.
 
    See also DIR, MKDIR, RMDIR, FILEATTRIB, COPYFILE, MOVEFILE, DELETE.
