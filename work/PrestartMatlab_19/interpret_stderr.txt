{Error: File: /work/PrestartMatlab_19/generatedSource.m Line: 6 Column: 1
"y" previously appeared to be used as a function or command, conflicting with
its use here as the name of a variable.
A possible cause of this error is that you forgot to initialize the variable,
or you have initialized it implicitly using load or eval.
