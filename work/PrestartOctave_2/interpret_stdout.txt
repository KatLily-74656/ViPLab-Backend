'ls' is a function from the file /usr/share/octave/4.0.3/m/miscellaneous/ls.m

 -- Command:  ls
 -- Command:  ls FILENAMES
 -- Command:  ls OPTIONS
 -- Command:  ls OPTIONS FILENAMES
 -- Function File: LIST = ls (...)
     List directory contents.

     The `ls' command is implemented by calling the native operating
     system's directory listing command--available OPTIONS will vary
     from system to system.

     Filenames are subject to shell expansion if they contain any
     wildcard characters `*', `?', `[]'.  To find a literal example of a
     wildcard character the wildcard must be escaped using the
     backslash operator `\'.

     If the optional output LIST is requested then `ls' returns a
     character array with one row for each file/directory name.

     Example usage on a UNIX-like system:

          ls -l
               -| total 12
               -| -rw-r--r--   1 jwe  users  4488 Aug 19 04:02 foo.m
               -| -rw-r--r--   1 jwe  users  1315 Aug 17 23:14 bar.m
